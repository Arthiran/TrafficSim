# Welcome to the TrafficSim Repository

This project started as a way to introduce myself to AI in Unreal Engine. The premise was to create AI which followed traffic lights and would randomly traverse throughout the city. The player is also able to have basic combat with the pedestrians.

UPDATE:
The project was used as a framework to create a firefighting simulation for a school project. It is now a prototype for a basic firefighting scenario where you put out a fire in a car accident.
